Delete the original st06.ecl (st6 midboss), st06bs.ecl (st6 spell 6) or st07bs.ecl (ex spell 11) files, according to what you want to practice.

Rename the following files :

st06MidbossPrac.ecl into st06.ecl  
(will make it so that stage 6 starts directly at the midboss)

st06bsSpell6Prac.ecl into st06bs.ecl 
(will make it so that on the Spell Practice menu, Stolen Release "Extreme Winter" starts Time Hindrance "Rewind of the Wet&Dry Seasons" instead. 
Timing it out will make the boss escape, just like the other spells. Though you can start this spell on Easy and Normal, it's still meant to be a Hard/Lunatic only spell)

st07bsSpell11Prac.ecl into st07bs.ecl 
(will make it so that on the Spell Practice menu, Secret God "Lingering Four Seasons" starts "The True Face of Everyone's Nobody" instead)

Watch out that no updates start putting the files back, or else you'll have to start over, in case this happens, delete the two files you wanted to swap, let the updates put the files back, and try swapping them again.

Once you're done practicing or want things to go back to normal, just delete the files and let the updates put them back how they were.
